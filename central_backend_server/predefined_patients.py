- Patient ethnicity: Caucasian
- Results of previous physical surgeries relevant for the disease (e.g. amputation, tracheostomy, pacemaker, appendectomy …): Cholecystectomy

# Chief complaint
- Chief complaint:
	* In medical terms, concrete and detailed: Increased urinary frequency and urgency accompanied by mild dysuria, onset over the past 3 days.
	* In layman's terms: "I've been having to go to the bathroom much more often, and it's a little uncomfortable when I pee."
- First statement the patient will make after the introduction or in the response to the examinee's opening question: "Well, doctor, for the last few days, I've just been feeling... off down there. I'm running to the bathroom more than usual, and it's a little bothersome when I go."

# History of present illness / Symptoms
- History of Present Illness (OPQRST): 
    *   Onset: Symptoms began gradually approximately 3 days ago. The patient first noticed an increased need to urinate more frequently than her baseline.
    *   Provocation/Palliation: No specific activities clearly worsen the symptoms, though the urgency feels more intense when her bladder is very full. Drinking more water makes her urinate more often, but doesn't change the discomfort. No specific relieving factors noted for the dysuria; emptying the bladder temporarily relieves the urgency.
    *   Quality: The discomfort during urination is described as a "mild burning" or "slight stinging" sensation, not severe pain. The urgency is a "sudden, compelling need to go."
    *   Radiation: The discomfort is localized to the urethra during urination, no radiation of pain.
    *   Severity: The dysuria is rated as 2/10 on a pain scale. The increased frequency and urgency are moderately bothersome, impacting her daily activities slightly.
    *   Timing: Symptoms have been persistent for the past 3 days, occurring throughout the day. She has also noticed having to get up once or twice at night to urinate, which is more than her usual (typically not at all).
- Aggravating factors: A very full bladder seems to intensify the feeling of urgency.
- Relieving factors: Emptying her bladder provides temporary relief from urgency. No specific relieving factors for the mild dysuria.
- Associated symptoms: Reports feeling a bit more tired than usual, which she attributes to interrupted sleep due to nocturia. Denies fever, chills, rigors, flank pain, back pain, nausea, vomiting, or vaginal discharge/pruritus. No gross hematuria.
- If specifically asked: what does the patient think is going on with their health: "I'm not entirely sure, perhaps a bit of a bladder irritation or a mild infection? My mother used to get something similar occasionally."
- If specifically asked: what is the patient's primary concern about the problem: "I'm mostly concerned it might get worse or be a sign of something more serious, especially with my diabetes. It's also quite inconvenient having to plan around bathroom breaks so much."

# Chief complaint
- Chief complaint:
	* In medical terms, concrete and detailed: Patient reports severe, persistent epigastric abdominal pain for the past 30 hours, associated with nausea and two episodes of vomiting.
	* In layman's terms: "Really bad stomach pain, up high, that won't go away, and I feel sick to my stomach."
- First statement the patient will make after the introduction or in the response to the examinee's opening question: "Doctor, I've got this awful pain in my upper belly, it's been going on for over a day now, and I just can't shake it. I feel like I might throw up."
# History of present illness / Symptoms
- History of Present Illness (OPQRST):
    *   Onset: "It started about 30 hours ago. It came on pretty strong over an hour or two, not like a switch flipped, but it definitely got bad quickly."
    *   Provocation/Palliation: "Eating anything makes it much worse. Moving around a lot also seems to stir it up. Lying very still helps a tiny bit. If I sit and lean forward slightly, that sometimes eases it a fraction, but not much."
    *   Quality: "It's a deep, sharp, and constant ache. Really intense, like something is boring into me."
    *   Radiation: "It's mostly right here in my upper stomach (points to epigastrium). Occasionally, I’ve felt a twinge of it going into my back, but that's not constant, more on and off."
    *   Severity: "It’s been a solid 8 out of 10, sometimes a 9. It’s one of the worst pains I’ve ever felt."
    *   Timing: "It's been constant since it really kicked in. Hasn't really let up at all."
- Aggravating factors: "Eating, any kind of movement."
- Relieving factors: "Lying very still. Bending forward a little when sitting provides minimal, temporary relief."

- If specifically asked: what does the patient think is going on with their health: "I really don't know. Maybe some kind of terrible food poisoning or a really bad stomach bug? But it feels much worse than any indigestion I've ever had."
- If specifically asked: what is the patient's primary concern about the problem: "Just how severe the pain is and the fact that it's not getting any better. I'm worried it could be something serious."
# Past medical history
